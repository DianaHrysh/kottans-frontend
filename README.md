## Git Basics 
That was an interesting introduction to git-adventure. 
1. I finished the [1st and 2nd weeks of Introduction to Git And GitHub by Google](https://github.com/DianaHrysh/kottans-frontend/blob/main/Git%20Basics/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-07%20at%2010.30.57%20AM.png) .
2. I also like interactive levels on [learngitbranching.js.org](https://github.com/DianaHrysh/kottans-frontend/blob/main/Git%20Basics/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-07%20at%2012.34.25%20AM.png). It really helps to understand how things work properly. 
3. However, I decided to make a pull-request only after 2) VCS (hello gitty), GitHub, and Collaboration due to my lack of knowledge of how to do this. 
UPD: pull-request is finally merged yay!!

 1. [Linux Survival 4 modules](https://github.com/DianaHrysh/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/IMG_8511.PNG) - was fun and quite easy to understand. I thought it would be more difficult to use the console as far as I've never seen it before. 
 2. HTTP: Протокол, який повинен розуміти кожний веб-розробник - Частина 1 and
 3. HTTP: Протокол, який повинен розуміти кожний веб-розробник - Частина 2 - were boring to read, sorry... I definitely remember the same info from another course (Meta Front-End Developer), but it was easier to memorize with videos.
