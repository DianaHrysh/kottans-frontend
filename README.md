## Git Basics 
That was an interesting introduction to git-adventure. I finished the [1st and 2nd weeks of Introduction to Git And GitHub by Google](https://github.com/DianaHrysh/kottans-frontend/blob/main/Git%20Basics/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-07%20at%2010.30.57%20AM.png) .
I also like interactive levels on [learngitbranching.js.org](https://github.com/DianaHrysh/kottans-frontend/blob/main/Git%20Basics/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-07%20at%2012.34.25%20AM.png). It really helps to understand how things work properly. 
However, I decided to make a pull-request only after 2. VCS (hello gitty), GitHub, and Collaboration due to my lack of knowledge of how to do this.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
 1. [Linux Survival 4 modules](https://github.com/DianaHrysh/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/IMG_8511.PNG) - was fun and quite easy to understand. I thought it would be more difficult to use the console as far as I've never seen it before. 
 2. HTTP: Протокол, який повинен розуміти кожний веб-розробник - Частина 1 and
 3. HTTP: Протокол, який повинен розуміти кожний веб-розробник - Частина 2 - were boring to read, sorry... I definitely remember the same info from another course (Meta Front-End Developer), but it was easier to memorize with videos.

## Git Collaboration
 1. I finished the 3rd and 4th weeks of Introduction to Git And GitHub by Google.
 2. Also managed to do learngitbranching.js.org:
Основи: Переміщуємо роботу туди-сюди
Віддалені репозиторії: Через origin – до зірок. Прогресивне використання Git Remotes
Everything is so unusual (but interesting) for me and it takes time to get used to this new tools.
